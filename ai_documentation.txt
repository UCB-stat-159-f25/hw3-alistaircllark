LLM of choice: Gemini Flash

I used the prompt "make two simple tests" along with the readligo.py file to generate tests.
After a couple of iterations plugging errors back into Gemini I got two passing tests.

I once again used the same prompt to create tests for utils.py and troubleshooted with Gemini.

Prompted for readme description: "Write a readme description"
Output: This repository represents the advanced, fully modularized, and production-ready version of the computational pipeline for the LIGO Open Science Center (LOSC) data project.

Building upon the initial data exploration in Homework 2, this iteration focuses on engineering excellence and robust deployment, transforming the project into a scalable and maintainable package.

Made a makefile based on the description.
