This repository represents the advanced, fully modularized, and production-ready version of the computational pipeline for the LIGO Open Science Center (LOSC) data project.

Building upon the initial data exploration in Homework 2, this iteration focuses on engineering excellence and robust deployment, transforming the project into a scalable and maintainable package.
